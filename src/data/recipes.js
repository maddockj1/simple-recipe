Add enough olive oil to create a paste-like consistency. If you\'re using apple cider vinegar or juice, add a tablespoon or two to the mixture.',
      'Coat the Chicken: Rub the marinade/mixture all over the chicken thighs, ensuring they are evenly coated.',
      'Marinate: Place the coated chicken in a resealable bag or container and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. For a deeper flavor, you can marinate them for up to a few hours.',
      'Preheat the Traeger: Set your Traeger grill to 250-275째F (120-135째C).',
      'Smoke the Chicken: Place the marinated chicken thighs directly on the grill grates.',
      'Cook: Cook for approximately 1.5 to 2.5 hours, or until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a thigh (without touching the bone) reads 165째F (74째C).',
      'Rest: Once cooked, remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest for 5-10 minutes before serving. This helps the juices redistribute, resulting in even more tender chicken.',
